# Weather-Forecasting-Tool-Python-


This is a command-line tool that fetches and displays the current weather forecast for any desired city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and utilizes Python for data parsing and manipulation. It provides an efficient way to access accurate and up-to-date weather information, allowing users to plan their activities, travels, and other day-to-day decision making.




# The solution includes the following components:

Integration with OpenWeatherMap API: The solution integrates with the     OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a given city. It makes use of the requests module in Python to send HTTP requests and fetch the weather information.


User Input: The solution accepts user input in the form of a city name. This input is used to query the OpenWeatherMap API for the weather forecast of the specified city.

Data Parsing: After receiving the weather data from the API, the solution parses the JSON response to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, etc. This data parsing is done using Python's built-in json module.


Error Handling: The solution incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues that may arise during the API request or data parsing process. It includes handling network errors, API errors, and JSON parsing errors. Error messages are displayed to the user in case of any errors encountered.
